Abstract:
By designing feedback to control populations of oscillators, synchronisation in neurons
causing epileptic seizures can be broken up. Oscillators (e.g. neurons) can be coupled on different levels.
The most basic level is through links between pairs of oscillators. These pairwise links fail to explain
phenomena such as peer pressure. The nonpairwise ‘links’ make such phenomena possible. Even
though the effects of these nonpairwise interactions have been observed, described and modeled in a
wide range of oscillatory systems, controlling nonpairwise interactions in arbitrary systems has
remained a mainly unexplored area. We generalize synchronisation engineering to control nonpairwise
interactions in arbitrary systems. As a first step, we design nonlinear time- delayed feedback that
introduces bifurcations away from splay configuration into arbitrary systems. Controlling nonpairwise
interactions might advance the design of minimum-power stimuli for the treatment of epilepsy.
