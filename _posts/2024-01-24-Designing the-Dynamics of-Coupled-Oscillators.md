Abstract:
By designing feedback to control populations of oscillators, we can control their synchonisation behaviour. Oscillators (e.g. neurons) can be coupled on different levels. The most basic level is through links between pairs of oscillators. However, these pairwise links fail to explain all phenomena that may be observed when nonpairwise ‘links’ are present. Even though the effects of these nonpairwise interactions have been observed, described and modeled in a wide range of oscillatory systems, controlling nonpairwise interactions in arbitrary populations of oscillators has remained a relatively unexplored area. In this thesis we generalise synchronisation engineering to control nonpairwise interactions in arbitrary systems. As a first step, we design a nonlinear time-delayed feedback that matches the bifurcation of both in-phase and splay configuration in to the nonpairwise target phase model.
