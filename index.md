# Bonnie Liefting

I defended my Phd in January 2024 at the Centre for Systems, Dynamics, and Control ([CSDC](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/research/csdc/)). My PhD project was supervised by [Christian Bick](https://www.math.vu.nl/~bick/) and [Kyle Wedgwood](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/kcaw201/index.html) and is entitled Designing the Dynamics of Coupled Oscillators.  

During the last year of my PhD I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science ([IMADA](https://imada.sdu.dk/)) at the University of Southern Denmark with [Kristian Debrabant](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/debrabant/index_en.php).
