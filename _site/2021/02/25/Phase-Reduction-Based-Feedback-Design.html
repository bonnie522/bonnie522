<h1>Phase Reduction Based Feedback Design</h1>

<p>

</p>

<p>Abstract: We will go through the concepts of oscillators, phase, isochrones, phase response curves and phase reduction. We then use phase reduction techniques to design weak nonlinear time-delayed feedback to control arbitrary oscillatory systems. The collective behaviour that we introduce to a system of oscillators in this way is described by a target phase model. In our generalisation of this (“synchronisation engineering”) approach, the target phase model can have nonpairwise interactions. Controlling nonpairwise interactions might advance the design of minimum-power stimuli for the treatment of epilepsy.</p>
