# Bonnie Liefting

I am a PhD Student at the Centre for Systems, Dynamics, and Control. My PhD project is with [Christian Bick](https://www.math.vu.nl/~bick/) and [Kyle Wedgwood](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/kcaw201/index.html) and is entitled Designing the Dynamics of Coupled Oscillators.  

I am currently a visiting PhD student at the University of Southern Denmark with [Kristian Debrabant](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/debrabant/index_en.php).
