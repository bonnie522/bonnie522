# Bonnie Liefting

I am currently working as a Research Assistant on the project [Dynamic network modelling of depression: towards personalised treatment targets](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en/dynamic-network-modelling-of-depression-towards-personalised-treatment-targets) with [Maria Semkovska](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/maria-semkovska) at the [Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/institutter_centre/institut_psykologi)

I defended my Phd in January 2024 at the Centre for Systems, Dynamics, and Control ([CSDC](https://mathematics.exeter.ac.uk/research/csdc/)). My PhD project was supervised by [Christian Bick](https://www.math.vu.nl/~bick/) and [Kyle Wedgwood](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/kcaw201/index.html) and is entitled [Designing the Dynamics of Coupled Oscillators](https://liefting.github.io/2024/01/24/Designing-the-Dynamics-of-Coupled-Oscillators.html).  

During the last year of my PhD I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science ([IMADA](https://imada.sdu.dk/)) at the University of Southern Denmark with [Kristian Debrabant](https://imada.sdu.dk/u/debrabant/index_en.php).
